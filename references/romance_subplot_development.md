- Provide character insights that aid in solving mysteries
- Create emotional investment for readers

- Layers of meaning (in clues and in interpersonal dynamics)

### Pacing Considerations

- Introduce romantic tension early but develop gradually
- Use mystery plot points to advance or complicate the romance
- Create emotional peaks and valleys that complement the mystery's tension

Introduce additional characters who affect the romantic subplot:

- **Maximilian Fairchild:** Creates a romantic triangle with Emily
- **Genevieve Dubois:** Complicates Alistair's emotional availability
- **Colleagues:** Provide commentary, support, or obstacles
- **Mentors:** Offer wisdom or warnings about personal entanglements

## Romance Subplot Pitfalls to Avoid

### The Romantic Plot Tumor

Avoid allowing the romance to overshadow the mystery elements that define the series:

- Keep romantic scenes proportional to mystery content
- Ensure romance serves character development and main plot

### Forced Conflict

Avoid artificial relationship problems:

- Ensure conflicts arise naturally from character traits and situations
- Base misunderstandings on established character perspectives

### Rushed Resolution

Avoid premature resolution of romantic tension:

- Maintain the slow burn across multiple books
