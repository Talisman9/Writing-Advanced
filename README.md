# The Veritas Codex

A mystery/cozy mystery series with contemporary romance elements set in the ancient, fictional university city of Veritas.

## Series Overview

"The Veritas Codex" is a series of mystery novels set in the fictional university city of Veritas, a blend of Oxford, Heidelberg, and Prague. The series follows Emily Robinson, a local history student, and Detective Inspector Alistair Finch as they investigate mysteries connected to the university's ancient past and the restricted section of the University of Veritas' Grand Library, known as the "Silentium."

## Setting

The ancient, fictional university city of Veritas is nestled in a valley somewhere in continental Europe. The city is built on the site of an even older settlement, with layers of history beneath it:

- Ancient Celtic/Roman Holy Site (with a sacred spring or grove)
- Medieval Monastery Scriptorium (where monks preserved and copied texts)
- Early University Library (open stacks, accessible to scholars)
- The Silentium (Restricted Section, housing dangerous, controversial, or magically-charged texts and artifacts)

## Main Characters

- **Emily Robinson**: A local history student at the University of Veritas. She's passionate, curious, and has an intuitive understanding of the city's hidden history. She's also got a bit of a rebellious streak and isn't afraid to bend the rules to uncover the truth.

- **Detective Inspector Alistair Finch**: A newly transferred detective to the Veritas police force. He's pragmatic, skeptical of anything supernatural or "unproven," and relies on logic and evidence. He's initially dismissive of Emily's theories but comes to respect her insights. He's also secretly a bit of a romantic, though he hides it well.

## Supporting Characters

- **Professor Alistair Thorne**: Emily's mentor, a kindly but eccentric professor of ancient history who knows more than he lets on (Ally).

- **Dr. Noah Hawkings**: The Head Librarian of the Silentium, a stern and protective guardian of its secrets (Ambiguous â€“ could be an ally or a red herring).

- **Maximilian Fairchild**: A rival for Emily's affections; ambitious, intellectual, bookish man from an old family, fellow student.

- **Genevieve Dubois**: A past love interest of Alistair's; elegant, seemingly sweet ex from a family of old money with a hidden agenda who reappears and causes complications.

- **Phoebe O'Connell**: Emily's friend/confidante; loyal, supportive, down-to-earth, and sarcastically humorous best friend who offers advice and support.

- **David Wagner**: Alistair's colleague/friend; serious, dedicated, slightly cynical, but ultimately loyal friend serving as a sounding board.
