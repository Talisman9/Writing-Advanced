# The Silentium: Restricted Section of the Grand Library

The Silentium is the restricted section of the University of Veritas' Grand Library and serves as the central location for many of the mysteries in The Veritas Codex series.

## Historical Transformation

The Silentium's location has undergone several transformations throughout history:

1. **Ancient Celtic/Roman Holy Site**: Originally a sacred spring or grove where the earliest inhabitants performed rituals
2. 2. **Medieval Monastery Scriptorium**: Later, monks built a monastery and scriptorium to preserve and copy texts
   3. 3. **Early University Library**: As the university grew, the library became more accessible to scholars
      4. 4. **The Silentium**: Gradually, certain texts were deemed too dangerous or controversial, leading to the creation of a restricted section
