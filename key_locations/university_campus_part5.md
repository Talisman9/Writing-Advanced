# University of Veritas Campus (Continued)

## Notable Campus Features

Several distinctive features make the Veritas campus unique:

1. **The Carillon Tower** - A 15th-century bell tower containing 49 bells that play melodies marking the hours and special occasions. The tower houses a small museum of horology and is open to visitors who can climb its 157 steps for panoramic views of the campus and city.

2. **The Botanical Gardens** - Established in 1621 as a medicinal garden, now containing over 5,000 plant species from around the world, including several extinct in the wild. The Victorian glasshouses contain tropical and desert collections.

3. **The Underground Passages** - A network of medieval tunnels connects many of the oldest buildings, originally created to allow monks to move between buildings in inclement weather. Now mostly closed for safety reasons, though certain sections are opened for guided tours.

4. **The Founder's Statue** - A bronze statue of the university's legendary founder, Archbishop Thomas de Veritas, stands in the central courtyard. His extended foot, polished bright by generations of students touching it for luck, contrasts with the green patina covering the rest of the statue.

5. **The Sundial Lawn** - A large circular lawn featuring an elaborate stone sundial at its center, surrounded by stone benches inscribed with quotes from famous alumni. The sundial's gnomon is designed so that its shadow falls on different quotes depending on the season.
