# University of Veritas Campus (Continued)

## Academic Organization

The University of Veritas is organized into six colleges, each with its own traditions, specialties, and residential facilities:

1. **St. Cyprian's College** - The oldest and most prestigious, occupying the heart of the Ancient Quarter. Specializes in Classics, Philosophy, and Theology.

2. **King's College** - Founded in 1420 under royal patronage, known for Politics, Law, and International Relations.

3. **Radcliffe College** - Established during the Enlightenment, focuses on Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Astronomy.

4. **Lady Margaret Hall** - The first women's college (now co-educational), known for Literature, Languages, and the Arts.

5. **Darwin College** - A Victorian addition specializing in Biological Sciences, Medicine, and Psychology.

6. **New College** - Despite its name, founded in 1925, focusing on Modern Subjects including Computer Science, Economics, and Media Studies.

Each college has its own dining hall, library, administrative offices, and student accommodations. Students belong to both their college and their academic department, creating a matrix organization that fosters both interdisciplinary connections and subject-specific expertise.

Academic departments are housed in buildings throughout campus, often grouped by discipline. The Science Complex in the northeastern quadrant contains laboratories and lecture halls for physics, chemistry, and engineering. The Humanities Building in the western section houses departments of history, literature, and philosophy. The Social Sciences Center in the south brings together economics, politics, and sociology.
