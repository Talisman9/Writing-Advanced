Okay, here is the full text of Chapter 4, incorporating the refinements we discussed regarding Emily's guess about "S.T." and her reaction to the symbol photograph.

## The Veritas Codex: The Astronomer's Secret
### Chapter 4: The Historian's Perspective

The interview room at the campus police station was small, functional, and smelled faintly of stale coffee and disinfectant. DI Alistair Finch watched Emily Robinson take the seat opposite him. He recognized her now – she was the young woman with the glasses and the armful of books he’d seen being interviewed by a uniformed officer in the Grand Library’s main reading room last night. Distressed then, composed now, though a faint tremor in her hands betrayed underlying nerves. Intelligent eyes, observant, taking in the sparse room with a quick, analytical sweep that reminded him, uncomfortably, of himself.

“Miss Robinson,” he began, keeping his tone neutral, professional. DS Morgan Chen sat to his right, notebook open, pen poised. “Thank you for coming in. As you know, we are investigating the death of Professor James Blackwood in the Grand Library archives yesterday evening.”

“Yes, I heard this morning,” she replied, her voice quiet but steady. “It’s shocking. Professor Blackwood was quite respected.”

“Did you know him personally?”

“No. I knew *of* him, of course. Visiting scholar from Cambridge, expert in Renaissance astronomy. His field overlaps slightly with my doctoral research.”

“Which is?” Alistair prompted, consulting the notes Morgan had passed him. Doctoral student, local history, guest access card holder for the restricted archives, though Hawkings had stated Blackwood was denied access to the *Silentium* collection specifically.

“Medieval and early Renaissance astronomical practices at the University of Veritas,” Emily answered readily. “I’m focusing on the transition from monastic observation methods to early university scientific instrumentation.”

Precise. Articulate. Knew her subject. Alistair made a note. “And your research required access to the restricted archives?”

“Yes, and also the museum’s collection. I was in the library’s main reading room yesterday morning, working with a 15th-century manuscript by Brother Thomas. Later, I visited the museum’s conservation lab.”

This matched her earlier statement to the uniformed officer. “Regarding Professor Blackwood, did you see him at the library yesterday? Interact with him?”

Emily hesitated for a fraction of a second. “No, I didn’t see him. I was primarily in the main reading room and then the museum. I wasn’t in the restricted archives section itself yesterday, only the reading room outside it for a short period.”

Alistair filed away the brief hesitation. “You mentioned the museum conservation lab. What were you viewing there?”

“Dr. Eleanor Wright is preparing an exhibition on scientific instruments. Professor Thorne suggested I look at an astrolabe they have – potentially relevant to my research.”

Professor Alistair Thorne. Blackwood’s host, Morgan had confirmed. Who had apparently directed this student towards the very artifact Blackwood was interested in. Interesting.

“Describe this astrolabe, please.”

Emily’s posture shifted subtly, leaning forward slightly, a spark of academic enthusiasm replacing her earlier caution. “It’s extraordinary, Inspector. Unlike any I’ve seen documented. It’s made primarily of silver, not brass. Likely early 16th century based on some features, possibly late 15th based on others – Dr. Wright mentioned the dating is contested. It has unusual scales, seven tympans, and significantly more star pointers on the rete than standard instruments of the period.” She paused, choosing her words. “And it has unique symbols engraved around the edge. They don’t match any known astronomical or alchemical notation I’m familiar with.”

Alistair kept his expression impassive, but inwardly, his attention sharpened considerably. Symbols. “Can you describe these symbols?”

“They appear in sequences, possibly eight groups. Intricate glyphs, angular characters surrounding what look like stylized celestial bodies.” She met his gaze directly now, the nervousness seemingly replaced by intellectual curiosity. “Actually, I believe I’ve seen similar markings elsewhere. In the marginalia of Brother Thomas’s manuscript from 1472, and possibly… possibly on some architectural elements around the university, though I’d need to check my notes and photos.”

Alistair glanced at Morgan, who gave an almost imperceptible nod. This corroborated elements of Blackwood's own research notes. He reached into the file before him and extracted a clear photograph of the symbol drawn on Professor Blackwood’s palm. He placed it on the table, turning it to face Emily.

“Do these symbols resemble the markings you saw on the astrolabe or in the manuscript?”

Emily leaned forward, her breath catching almost imperceptibly as she studied the photograph. Her eyes widened, pupils dilating for a fraction of a second as the connection slammed into place – the abstract symbols from her research, from the gleaming silver astrolabe she’d handled just yesterday, now starkly displayed on a murder victim’s palm. A flicker of genuine fear – cold and sharp – crossed her features before academic discipline snapped back like a shield, masking it. She met Alistair’s watchful gaze, her own expression carefully neutral now, though her heart hammered against her ribs.

“Yes,” she said, her voice quiet, perhaps a fraction too controlled. “They’re… they’re undeniably similar. The style, the components… particularly that central star-like figure and the angular characters. That’s part of the sequence I saw on the astrolabe in the museum lab, and it strongly resembles the fragment in Brother Thomas’s manuscript.”

Bingo. The first concrete link between the victim, his research focus, and the bizarre staging of the crime scene. Alistair felt the familiar click of disparate facts aligning into a potential pattern, even as his rational mind balked at the strangeness of it all – ancient symbols, a silver astrolabe, a murdered academic.

“Miss Robinson,” he said, his tone deliberately level. “Professor Blackwood was actively researching this specific silver astrolabe shortly before his death. His notebook contained sketches of it and references to verifying its markings against an ‘S.T. manuscript’. Does that abbreviation mean anything to you?”

Emily frowned in concentration, tapping a finger against her chin. “‘S.T.’? Monastic or early academic texts often used standard abbreviations… *Scriptura Sacra*, perhaps, for biblical commentary, or *Summa Theologica*… but in an astronomical context?” She considered possibilities aloud, more thinking than answering directly. “*Stellarum Tabulae* – star tables – is plausible. Or perhaps it referred to a specific location or collection within the university… *Scriptorium Thesauri* – treasury of the scriptorium? *Sigillum Templi* – seal of the temple, referring back to the Roman foundations? It’s not a standard astronomical reference I immediately recognize from that period, which is interesting in itself.” She trailed off, looking thoughtful rather than certain. “Blackwood finding it noteworthy suggests it was specific, perhaps even coded.”

Alistair appreciated her ability to separate academic curiosity from the grim reality of the crime scene, and her methodical approach to the abbreviation, even if it didn't yield an immediate answer. He made a mental note; the "S.T." needed further investigation, potentially cross-referencing with known restricted collections or historical site names.

“Why do you think Professor Blackwood would be interested in this astrolabe and these symbols?” he asked.

Emily leaned back slightly, considering. “From an academic perspective? The contested dating, the unusual materials, the unknown symbols, the potential connection to Brother Thomas… it’s a significant historical puzzle. It could rewrite our understanding of scientific instrument development at Veritas, perhaps even link it to esoteric traditions outside mainstream astronomy. Any scholar would be intrigued.” She paused. “But the symbol on his… on the photograph. That suggests something else entirely. Something more deliberate. A message?”

Alistair appreciated her ability to separate academic curiosity from the grim reality of the crime scene. “That’s what we need to determine. You mentioned photographing the symbols in Brother Thomas’s manuscript?”

“Yes, and I took reference photos in the museum lab yesterday – of the astrolabe itself.”

“I’ll need copies of those photographs, Miss Robinson. And any notes you have relating to these symbols or the astrolabe.”

“Of course,” she agreed readily. “I can email them this afternoon.”

“Thank you.” Alistair gathered the file. “One more thing. Dr. Hawkings provided a list of individuals with guest access cards to the restricted archives during the relevant period. Besides Professor Blackwood and a visiting professor from Princeton, the only other name was yours.”

Emily nodded slowly, understanding the implication. “I haven't used the card for the archives themselves in over a week. My recent work has been in the main reading room and the museum.”

“We’ll verify that with the logs and Dr. Wright.” He stood, signaling the end of the interview. “Miss Robinson, this is now an active homicide investigation. Your research appears to overlap significantly with Professor Blackwood’s interests, which unfortunately places you in proximity to these events. I must caution you against conducting your own inquiries or interfering with police procedure. If you recall anything further, or if anyone connected to this research contacts you, call DS Chen immediately.”

Emily stood as well, clutching her satchel. “I understand, Inspector. But… the history *is* the inquiry, isn't it? Finding out why Blackwood was killed seems inseparable from understanding what he discovered about that astrolabe and those symbols.”

Alistair met her earnest gaze. She wasn’t wrong, and that was the problem. This wasn’t a simple case of motive, means, and opportunity. It was tangled in centuries of academic secrets. “Leave the criminal investigation to us, Miss Robinson. Focus on your dissertation.”

He watched her leave, a thoughtful expression on his face. Morgan Chen raised an eyebrow.

“Well?” Morgan asked. “Academic prodigy or potential complication?”

“Both, I suspect,” Alistair murmured. “Verify her timeline for yesterday with the library and museum logs. Get copies of those photos she mentioned – manuscript and astrolabe symbols. Compare them meticulously to the symbol from the scene.” He tapped the photograph of the marking on Blackwood’s palm. “This symbol is our strongest lead right now. It connects the victim to the object of his research.”

“And maybe to his killer,” Morgan added quietly.

“Maybe.” Alistair looked back at the crime scene photos pinned to the whiteboard. The ordered chaos, the historical setting, the cryptic symbol. This case felt different, deeper than the street violence or domestic disputes he usually handled. It felt like Veritas itself held secrets, and Professor Blackwood had stumbled onto one he shouldn’t have.

He thought of Emily Robinson’s intelligent eyes, the way she connected historical dots. She was right; the history was inseparable from the crime. And despite his professional reservations, Alistair had a feeling he’d need the historian’s perspective before this was over.
