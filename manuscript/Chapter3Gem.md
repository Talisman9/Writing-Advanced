## The Veritas Codex: The Astronomer's Secret
### Chapter 3: Echoes in the Archives

The insistent buzzing dragged Emily from a restless sleep filled with fragmented images: gleaming silver curves, cryptic symbols swirling like constellations, the unnerving intensity in Dr. Wright’s eyes. She fumbled for her phone on the bedside table, squinting at the bright screen. 7:15 AM. And three missed calls from Phoebe.

A knot of unease tightened in Emily’s stomach. Phoebe wasn’t usually an early caller unless something was wrong. She swiped to return the call, pushing herself upright in bed. Her small apartment in the Old Quarter, usually a cozy haven with its slanted floors and stacks of books, felt suddenly claustrophobic. The morning light slanting through the leaded glass window seemed pale and weak.

Phoebe answered on the first ring, her voice tight with anxiety. “Emily! Thank god. Didn’t you see the university alert?”

“Alert? No, I just woke up. What’s going on?”

“You haven’t heard? Em, it’s awful. They found a body in the Grand Library last night. In the archives section.”

The room seemed to tilt. “A body? Who?” Emily’s mind instantly flashed to the restricted archives, Dr. Hawkings’ guarded demeanor, the police asking questions about the astrolabe yesterday.

“A visiting professor, apparently. James Blackwood, from Cambridge? Does that name mean anything to you?”

Emily’s breath hitched. Professor Blackwood. The name hadn't registered when she overheard Maggie at The Scholar's Cup mentioning police inquiries, but now, linked to a body *in the archives*… “No,” she lied automatically, a historian’s instinct to gather facts before revealing connections kicking in. “That’s terrible. Do they know what happened?”

“They’re saying murder,” Phoebe whispered, the word hanging heavy in the air. “The police were there all night. The library’s closed today, maybe longer. Em, are you okay? You were just in the museum yesterday, asking about artifacts…”

“I’m fine, Phoebe, really.” Emily swung her legs out of bed, needing to move, to think. “Just shocked. A murder… at the university library.” It felt like a violation, a desecration of a sacred space.

“Listen,” Phoebe said, her voice regaining some of its usual practicality. “Just… be careful, okay? With all the weird stuff you were looking into yesterday, the restricted texts, that astrolabe… Maybe lay low for a bit?”

“I can’t lay low now, Phoebs. If Professor Blackwood was killed in the archives…” Emily’s mind raced. Was he researching the astrolabe too? Was that why the police were asking questions *before* the body was found? Or was Maggie’s gossip inaccurate? “…it might be connected to something historical. Something important.”

“Or something dangerous,” Phoebe countered. “Promise me you’ll be careful? Meet me at Antiqua later? Say, eleven?”

“Okay, eleven at Antiqua. And yes, I’ll be careful.” Emily ended the call, her hand trembling slightly.

She quickly dressed, opting for practical jeans and a sweater, her usual vintage touches feeling frivolous today. She forced down some toast and tea, her appetite gone, her thoughts consumed by the news. Professor Blackwood. Murdered. In the restricted archives. While researching astronomical instruments, according to Professor Thorne. And police had been asking about the silver astrolabe *yesterday*.

Emily pulled out her phone again, scrolling back through the photos she’d taken in the conservation lab. The gleaming silver astrolabe filled the screen. She zoomed in on the strange symbols around the edge, comparing them again to the photo of the marginalia in Brother Thomas’s 15th-century manuscript. The resemblance was undeniable. Had Blackwood seen this connection too? Was *that* why he was killed?

She needed more information. Checking the university news portal confirmed the basics: body discovered, identified as Blackwood, police investigation ongoing, library closed. No mention of the astrolabe or the specific location within the archives. The official narrative was tightly controlled, just as Provost Harrington likely wanted, according to Alistair Finch’s internal thoughts Emily couldn't know about.

What would DI Finch make of this? The stern, analytical detective she’d briefly encountered yesterday when campus security had questioned her about photographing library architecture (a separate, minor incident she hadn't even mentioned to Phoebe). He hadn't seemed the type to entertain theories about ancient symbols and historical conspiracies. Yet, he was investigating. And Maggie and Dr. Wright both said the police were interested in the astrolabe.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it wasn't Phoebe. An unfamiliar number. She hesitated, then answered.

“Miss Emily Robinson?” a crisp, professional female voice asked.

“Speaking.”

“This is Detective Sergeant Morgan Chen, Veritas Police. DI Finch would like to speak with you regarding the investigation at the Grand Library. Would you be available to come to the campus police station at ten this morning?”

Emily’s heart gave a lurch. They knew she was researching related topics, or perhaps just that she was one of the students with recent access privileges near the area. “Yes, I can be there at ten.”

“Thank you, Miss Robinson. Ask for DI Finch at the front desk.” The line clicked dead.

So much for laying low. Emily glanced at the clock. Just over an hour. Time enough to visit Professor Thorne first. If anyone understood the dangerous undercurrents of Veritas history, it was him. And she needed to return the Regiomontanus book anyway.

Professor Thorne’s office door was closed when Emily arrived at Radcliffe Hall just after nine. She knocked softly. After a moment, the door opened, revealing Thorne looking unusually tired, his silver hair even more chaotic than usual.

“Emily,” he said, his voice subdued. “Come in. Terrible news, isn’t it?”

“I just heard,” Emily said, stepping into the familiar clutter of books and papers. “Professor Blackwood.”

Thorne nodded grimly, gesturing her towards the chair. “A tragedy. A genuine loss to the academic community. And in the library itself… unthinkable.” He sank into his own chair. “The police have already spoken to me, as his host.”

“Did they… did they mention what he was working on?” Emily asked carefully.

“They asked about his research, yes. I told them about his interest in our collection of astronomical instruments, particularly the Renaissance period.” Thorne watched her closely. “Did you manage to see that astrolabe at the museum yesterday?”

“I did,” Emily confirmed. “It’s… extraordinary. And Professor, the symbols engraved on it? They match markings in the margin of Brother Thomas’s 1472 manuscript.”

Thorne leaned forward, his fatigue momentarily forgotten, replaced by keen interest. “Do they indeed? Fascinating! Brother Thomas and the astrolabe… that suggests a connection predating its supposed 16th-century origins. Or perhaps Thomas was documenting something much older.” He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “Blackwood would have found that significant. He was convinced the official timeline of certain university acquisitions was… incomplete.”

“The police asked you about the astrolabe?” Emily pressed.

“In passing. They seemed more interested in Blackwood’s recent activities, his appointments.” Thorne waved a dismissive hand. “Standard procedure.” He looked at Emily again. “But *you* saw the astrolabe yesterday. And now Blackwood is dead. Coincidence, perhaps. But in Veritas, coincidence often wears the mask of design.” His eyes held a warning. “Be careful, Emily. Some historical inquiries attract unwelcome attention.”

“The police want to speak with me,” Emily admitted. “At ten.”

Thorne nodded slowly. “Understandable. You were likely one of the last people involved in related research. Answer their questions truthfully, of course. But remember,” he leaned forward slightly, his voice dropping, “some knowledge requires careful stewardship. Not everything needs to be laid bare for bureaucratic dissection.”

Emily left Thorne’s office feeling more unsettled than ever. His concern felt genuine, yet his words held the familiar echo of academic gatekeeping, the same sense she got from Dr. Hawkings and the Silentium's restrictions. She thanked him for the Regiomontanus book and promised to return it soon.

With twenty minutes before her appointment, Emily walked briskly towards the campus police station, a modern building jarringly inserted between older faculties near the edge of New Town. The quad seemed subdued today, students gathered in quiet knots, whispering. The usual cheerful energy was replaced by a somber curiosity. The murder had cast a pall over Veritas.

She entered the station, the sterile environment a stark contrast to the ancient halls she usually frequented. Giving her name at the desk, she was asked to wait. She sat on an uncomfortable plastic chair, clutching her satchel, her mind racing through connections: Blackwood, the astrolabe, the symbols, Brother Thomas, the Silentium, restricted texts, Hawkings’ evasiveness, Thorne’s cryptic warnings, the police interest preceding the murder… It felt like pieces of a vast, centuries-old puzzle clicking into place, revealing a picture she wasn’t sure she was ready to see.

A door opened, and Detective Sergeant Morgan Chen emerged. “Miss Robinson? DI Finch will see you now.”

Emily stood, took a deep breath, and followed DS Chen down a short corridor into a small, functional interview room. Seated at the table, looking up from a file, was Detective Inspector Alistair Finch. His sharp blue eyes assessed her coolly as she entered, his expression unreadable. This was not the dismissive officer briefly encountered yesterday; this was the homicide detective, methodical and focused. The investigation, Emily realized, had truly begun. And somehow, she was already part of it.
