# The Veritas Codex - Series-Wide Story Arc

## Overarching Mystery

The series-wide mystery of "The Veritas Codex" revolves around the true history of Veritas and the purpose of the Silentium. As the series progresses, Emily and Alistair gradually uncover that:

1. The city of Veritas was built on a site of unusual power, where the veil between worlds is thin
2. The original Celtic sacred spring and later Roman temple were dedicated to wisdom and truth-seeking
3. The monastery was founded by monks who discovered ancient texts revealing forbidden knowledge
4. The university was established to control and protect this knowledge rather than simply to advance learning
5. The Silentium exists to contain texts and artifacts that could destabilize reality if misused
6. A recurring threat throughout history has attempted to use this knowledge for power

## The Custodians and Their Adversaries

Two opposing forces have operated in Veritas throughout its history:

### The Custodians
- Originally formed to protect dangerous knowledge from misuse
- Evolved into a secretive organization with branches in academia, local government, and business
- Use a corrupted version of the Veritas Symbol as their mark
- Have become increasingly dogmatic and controlling over centuries
- Some members have lost sight of the original purpose and now seek power
- Factions exist within the organization with different interpretations of their mission

### The Seekers
- Believe knowledge should be freely available regardless of consequences
- Have attempted throughout history to expose the secrets of the Silentium
- Use the complete Veritas Symbol in its original form
- Range from idealistic scholars to dangerous extremists
- Often responsible for "incidents" that have led to tighter restrictions
- Currently operating in cells with different agendas
