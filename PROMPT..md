### Phase 3: Initial Draft Creation
1. **Draft Initial Section**
   - Create drafts/Section1.md with initial narrative section
   - Apply writing style guidelines:
     ```
     # Writing Style Guidelines
     
     ## Avoid Common AI Patterns
     - Never explicitly state thematic relevance
     - Show character emotions through actions and physical responses
     - Use concrete sensory details instead of abstract descriptions
     - Vary sentence structure and length
     - Avoid repetitive paragraph openings
     - Create natural dialogue with subtext and interruptions
     - Use specific, unexpected details rather than generic descriptions
     
     ## Examples
     
     ### Avoid (AI-like):
     "She finally allowed herself to feel the full weight of what they'd accomplished. The prototype wasn't just a technological breakthrough; it was a philosophical one."
     
     ### Prefer (Human-like):
     "Her hands trembled as she powered down the prototype. In the sudden silence, someone popped a bottle of champagne. The cork ricocheted off the ceiling tiles while the team erupted in cheers around her."

### Phase 4: Iterative Development
1. **Expand Draft Sections**
   - For each narrative section:
     - Create drafts/Section{n}.md
     - Reference planning documents via URLs
     - Apply writing quality checks:
       ```
       # Before committing, verify:
       grep -v -i -E "realize|suddenly|obviously|clearly|exactly|simply|just|very|really|actually" drafts/Section{n}.md
       grep -v -E "was [a-z]+ing|were [a-z]+ing" drafts/Section{n}.md
       grep -v -E "^(She|He|They|It|The) [a-z]+" drafts/Section{n}.md | head -n 10
       ```
     - Commit: `git add drafts/Section{n}.md && git commit -m "[DRAFT] Add Section {n}" && git push origin main`
     - Update PROGRESS.md:
       ```
       # Read current progress
       CURRENT_PROGRESS=$(cat PROGRESS.md)
       
       # Update with new progress
       cat > PROGRESS.md << EOL
       # Project Progress Tracker
       
       ## Completed Tasks
       $(grep -A 30 "## Completed Tasks" <<< "$CURRENT_PROGRESS" | tail -n +2)
       - $(date): Completed Section {n}
       
       ## In-Progress Tasks
       - Section development ($(($n+1))/${TOTAL_SECTIONS})
       
       ## Upcoming Tasks
       $(grep -A 10 "## Upcoming Tasks" <<< "$CURRENT_PROGRESS" | tail -n +2)
       EOL
       ```
     - Update STATE.md:
       ```
       # Read current state
       CURRENT_STATE=$(cat STATE.md)
       
       # Calculate total word count
       WORD_COUNT=$(wc -w drafts/*.md | grep total | awk '{print $1}')
       
       # Update with new section state
       cat > STATE.md << EOL
       # Current Narrative State
       
       ## World State
       $(grep -A 10 "## World State" <<< "$CURRENT_STATE" | tail -n +2)
       
       ## Character State
       $(grep -A 10 "## Character State" <<< "$CURRENT_STATE" | tail -n +2)
       
       ## Plot State
       - Current phase: Section development
       - Completed sections: {n}
       - Active conflicts: $(if [ $n -gt $(($TOTAL_SECTIONS/2)) ]; then echo "Escalating"; else echo "Developing"; fi)
       - Unresolved elements: $(if [ $n -eq $TOTAL_SECTIONS ]; then echo "Resolved"; else echo "In progress"; fi)
       - Current word count: $WORD_COUNT
       EOL
       ```
     - Update TASKS.md:
       ```
       # Read current tasks
       CURRENT_TASKS=$(cat TASKS.md)
       
       # Update section development progress
       if [ $n -eq $TOTAL_SECTIONS ]; then
         SECTION_STATUS="[x]"
       else
         SECTION_STATUS="[-]"
       fi
       
       # Update task status
       cat > TASKS.md << EOL
       # Task Breakdown for {TITLE}
       
       ## Planning Phase
       - [x] World-building
       - [x] Character development
       - [x] Plot construction
       
       ## Development Phase
       - [x] Initial draft
       - [x] Feedback integration
       - $SECTION_STATUS Section development
       
       $(grep -A 20 "## Refinement Phase" <<< "$CURRENT_TASKS" | tail -n +1)
       EOL
       ```
     - Commit: `git add PROGRESS.md STATE.md TASKS.md && git commit -m "[PROG] Update progress after Section {n}" && git push origin main`

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - After each section:
     - Update DEPENDENCIES.md:
       ```
       # Read current dependencies
       CURRENT_DEPS=$(cat DEPENDENCIES.md)
       
       # Add new connections based on section content
       cat > DEPENDENCIES.md << EOL
       # Narrative Dependencies
       
       ## Character Dependencies
       $(grep -A 10 "## Character Dependencies" <<< "$CURRENT_DEPS" | tail -n +2)
       - [New character dependency from Section {n}]
       
       ## Plot Dependencies
       $(grep -A 10 "## Plot Dependencies" <<< "$CURRENT_DEPS" | tail -n +2)
       - [New plot dependency from Section {n}]
       
       ## Thematic Dependencies
       $(grep -A 10 "## Thematic Dependencies" <<< "$CURRENT_DEPS" | tail -n +2)
       - [New thematic connection from Section {n}]
       EOL
       ```
     - Commit: `git add DEPENDENCIES.md && git commit -m "[DEP] Update dependencies after Section {n}" && git push origin main`

3. **Refinement Cycles**
   - For each refinement pass:
     - Create .github/workflows/refinement{n}.md with refinement focus
     - Create writing quality verification script:
       ```
       #!/bin/bash
       
       echo "Running writing quality checks..."
       
       # Check for explicit thematic statements
       echo "Checking for explicit thematic statements..."
       grep -i -E "lesson|moral|theme|meaning|significance|symbolize|represent" drafts/*.md
       
       # Check for telling instead of showing
       echo "Checking for telling instead of showing..."
       grep -i -E "felt|realized|knew|understood|thought|believed" drafts/*.md
       
       # Check for sentence variety
       echo "Analyzing sentence beginnings for variety..."
       grep -o -E "^[A-Z][a-z]+ [a-z]+" drafts/*.md | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
       
       # Check for adverb overuse
       echo "Checking for adverb overuse..."
       grep -o -E "[a-z]+ly" drafts/*.md | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

     - Check for explicit thematic statements
     - Verify show-don't-tell for emotions
     - Examine dialogue for naturalness
     - Verify sentence structure variety
     - Check for repetitive paragraph structures

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT DIRECTIVES

### Memory Optimization
- **URL References**: Always use GitHub URLs to reference files
- **State Tracking**: Regularly read and update STATE.md to maintain narrative continuity
- **Chunking**: Split any file exceeding 2000 words
- **Purging**: Summarize completed work in PROGRESS.md

### GitHub Utilization
- **Commit Frequency**: After every meaningful change
- **Issue Tracking**: Use .github/issues/ for questions/problems
- **Reference Storage**: Store all external references in references/
- **Resource Management**: Store all resources in resources/

### Communication Protocol
- **Response Format**: 
  ```
  [ACTION]: {action completed}
  [STATUS]: {current status}
  [URL]: {GitHub URL to relevant file}
  [NEXT]: {next step in process}
  ```
- **Pause Points**: Only at specified PAUSE markers
- **Error Handling**: Create .github/issues/error_{timestamp}.md for any issues

## WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES

### Avoid AI-Like Writing
- **Never explicitly state themes**: Let thematic elements emerge naturally through events and character actions
- **Show, don't tell**: Convey emotions through physical sensations and observable behaviors
- **Use concrete details**: Employ specific, unexpected details rather than generic descriptions
- **Vary sentence structure**: Avoid repetitive sentence patterns and paragraph openings
- **Create natural dialogue**: Include interruptions, dialect variations, and subtext
- **Employ subtlety**: Trust readers to infer meaning without explicit explanation
- **Avoid clichÃ©s**: Replace common phrases with fresh, original language

### Examples

#### Avoid (AI-like):
"She finally allowed herself to feel the full weight of what they'd accomplished. The prototype wasn't just a technological breakthrough; it was a philosophical one."

#### Prefer (Human-like):
"Her hands trembled as she powered down the prototype. In the sudden silence, someone popped a bottle of champagne. The cork ricocheted off the ceiling tiles while the team erupted in cheers around her."

## FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Seamless narrative of [Word count range] words
- No meta-commentary or explanations
- Pure narrative content only
- Saved as {TITLE}.{OUTPUT_FORMAT}
- All supporting files maintained in repository
