# World-Building Consistency Review: The Veritas Codex

## Overview
This document analyzes the existing world-building elements across "The Veritas Codex" project, identifies potential inconsistencies or gaps, and provides solutions to strengthen the cohesiveness of Veritas as a setting. The goal is to ensure that all established elements of the university, city, Silentium, and historical layers work together seamlessly.

## Core Setting Elements

### Veritas City
#### Consistent Elements
- European location in a valley (blend of Oxford, Heidelberg, and Prague influences)
- Built on layers of history: Celtic/Roman holy site → Medieval monastery → Early university → Modern university
- Contains hidden passages, secret rooms, and encoded architectural messages
- Features the Old Market Square as a central hub for city life

#### Potential Inconsistencies
- **Geographic Specificity**: The exact location in Europe remains deliberately vague, which works for the fictional setting but may create challenges when referencing real historical events
- **City Size**: No clear indication of population size or physical boundaries
- **Modern Context**: Limited information on how Veritas exists in the contemporary world (tourism, industry, relationship to surrounding regions)

#### Enhancement Recommendations
1. **Create City Map**: Develop a detailed map showing key districts, the university's position within the city, and major landmarks
2. **Establish Population Parameters**: Define approximate population (suggest 150,000-200,000 with 30,000 students)
3. **Define Modern Context**: Establish Veritas as primarily academic with limited tourism focused on historical architecture, minimal industry, and relative isolation that has preserved its character
4. **Clarify Geographic Position**: While keeping exact location ambiguous, establish that Veritas is in a mountainous region of Central Europe with cultural influences from Germanic, Slavic, and Latin traditions

### University of Veritas
