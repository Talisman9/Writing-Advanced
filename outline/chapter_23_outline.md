## Chapter Purpose
- Develop the concept of convergence points and their significance
- Explore the academic side of the investigation through research
- Create tension through surveillance and growing danger
- Deepen the relationship between Emily and Alistair
- Set up the next major discovery in the mystery

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: Academic Research
- **Setting:** University archives, morning
- **Characters:** Emily, Phoebe, archival assistant
- **Scene Goal:** Researching convergence theory in academic sources
- **Conflict:** Limited access vs. need for comprehensive information
- **Information Revealed:** Scientific papers theorizing about energy points in Veritas
- **Information Concealed:** Archival assistant reporting their research to someone

### Scene 2: Comparing Notes
- **Setting:** Emily's apartment, afternoon
- **Characters:** Emily, Alistair, Eliza
- **Scene Goal:** Combining Seeker knowledge with academic research
- **Conflict:** Different interpretations of the convergence theory
- **Information Revealed:** Pattern of historical events occurring at convergence points
- **Information Concealed:** Eliza's suspicion that they're being watched

### Scene 3: Unexpected Warning
- **Setting:** Campus coffee shop, evening
- **Characters:** Emily, Maximilian (appearing unexpectedly)
- **Scene Goal:** Emily getting coffee before returning to research
- **Conflict:** Distrust of Maximilian vs. his apparent concern
