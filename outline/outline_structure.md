## Implementation Approach

The chapter-by-chapter outline will be developed in sequential order, with each chapter building logically on previous chapters. The outline will be detailed enough to serve as a comprehensive roadmap for drafting while allowing flexibility for creative development during the writing process.

Each chapter outline will be saved as a separate file in the outline directory with the naming convention `chapter_XX_outline.md` where XX is the chapter number. This will facilitate easy updates and version control through GitHub.

The complete outline will serve as the foundation for Milestone 1 in the manuscript development plan and will be reviewed holistically for pacing, structure, and narrative coherence before proceeding to the drafting phase.
