# Chapter Five: Reluctant Allies

Detective Inspector Alistair Finch stared at the photograph of Emily Robinson spread across his desk. Not a mugshot—though technically she had been detained last night—but her university ID photo. Dark hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, intelligent eyes that seemed to challenge the camera, the hint of a smile that suggested she knew something the photographer didn't.

"So this is our trespasser," he said, glancing up at Constable Wagner.

"Yes, sir. Campus security found her taking photographs of the cornerstone at the Grand Library after hours. Apparently, she was quite insistent that she wasn't doing anything wrong."

Alistair suppressed a smile. "I imagine she was."

He flipped through the incident report. Emily Robinson, 24, doctoral student in local history, specializing in medieval astronomical practices at the University of Veritas. No criminal record, not even a parking ticket. Currently living in a flat on Bridge Street, just across from the river.

"And we're interviewing her because...?"

Wagner shifted uncomfortably. "Chief Inspector Blackwood flagged it. Said anything unusual happening around the university buildings should be brought to your attention, given the Chambers case."

Alistair nodded slowly. The Edward Chambers murder had been his assignment since transferring to Veritas three weeks ago—a cold case from 1972 that his superiors clearly expected to remain cold. A busy-work assignment for the new detective from London, meant to keep him occupied while he learned the rhythms of this peculiar city.

"Send her in, then," he said, closing the file.

Wagner opened the door, and Emily Robinson entered the interview room with the confident stride of someone who had rehearsed this moment. She wore jeans and a burgundy jumper beneath a well-worn leather jacket—casual but put-together. Her eyes immediately took in every detail of the room before settling on Alistair.

"Miss Robinson, I'm Detective Inspector Finch. Please, have a seat."

She sat across from him, her posture relaxed but alert. "Am I being charged with something, Detective Inspector?"

"That depends on whether you make a habit of photographing university buildings after hours."

"The university is my workplace. I'm a doctoral student researching—"

"Medieval astronomical practices, yes." Alistair tapped her file. "Though I'm curious how that relates to photographing architectural elements at eleven o'clock at night."

Emily leaned forward slightly. "I was documenting symbols carved into the cornerstone of the Grand Library. Symbols that match markings I found on a historical artifact in the university's collection."

"And this documentation couldn't wait until daylight hours?"

"The carvings are only visible when light hits them at a specific angle. Last night's conditions were ideal." She paused, studying his face. "Detective Inspector, I wasn't trespassing. The grounds are open to students until midnight."

Alistair made a note, more to give himself time to think than to record her statement. There was something about her direct gaze that was both refreshing and unsettling.

"Tell me about these symbols," he said finally.

A flicker of surprise crossed her face, quickly replaced by cautious interest. "They're unusual markings that don't correspond to any standard medieval iconography. I found them first on a silver astrolabe in the Silentium's collection, then realized similar symbols appear on various historical structures throughout Veritas."

Alistair kept his expression neutral, but his pulse quickened. "And what do you believe these symbols represent?"

"I'm not sure yet. They could be maker's marks, astronomical notations, or something else entirely." She tilted her head slightly. "Why is a detective interested in obscure historical symbols?"

Instead of answering, Alistair opened a drawer and removed a manila folder. From it, he extracted a photograph and placed it on the desk between them.

"Do these look familiar?"

Emily leaned forward, her eyes widening. The photograph showed a wooden desk surface with symbols carved into its edge—symbols remarkably similar to those she'd described.

"Where did you take this?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"I didn't. This photograph is from 1972, part of a murder investigation." Alistair watched her reaction carefully. "Professor Edward Chambers was found dead in his office at the university. These markings were carved into his desk."

Emily sat back, her expression shifting from surprise to intense focus. "Professor Chambers... he was researching the founding of the Silentium."

It was Alistair's turn to be surprised. "How do you know that?"

"His name appears in the Silentium's access logs from that period. I came across them while researching my dissertation." She gestured toward the photograph. "These symbols match a sequence from the silver astrolabe."

Alistair felt the familiar tingle at the base of his skull—the sensation that had guided him through complex cases in London, the instinct that something significant was unfolding.

"Miss Robinson, I think we may be investigating connected matters from different angles."

"You think these symbols are related to Professor Chambers' death?"

"I think it's a remarkable coincidence that you're researching the same symbols that were found at a murder scene." He held up a hand as she began to protest. "I'm not suggesting you're involved. But you might have stumbled onto something significant."

Emily studied him for a moment, then reached into her bag and removed a notebook. She flipped it open to reveal careful sketches of symbols identical to those in the crime scene photograph.

"These are from the astrolabe," she said, pushing the notebook toward him. "And these"—she flipped to another page—"are the ones I photographed last night at the Grand Library. There are others scattered throughout the city. I believe they form some kind of pattern or map."

Alistair examined her notes. Her sketches were precise, annotated with locations and observations. Whatever else Emily Robinson might be, she was methodical.

"You've been busy," he said.

"I'm thorough." She closed the notebook. "Detective Inspector, why is a recent transfer from London investigating a fifty-year-old cold case?"

Alistair raised an eyebrow. "You've been researching me as well?"

"Your name plate is new. Your accent isn't local. And you have a copy of the London A-Z on your shelf." She shrugged. "I notice details."

"Clearly." He leaned back in his chair, making a decision. "The Chambers case was never solved. Several people who investigated it were subsequently transferred or resigned under unusual circumstances. When I arrived three weeks ago, it was assigned to me—presumably because no one expected an outsider to make progress."

"But you have made progress."

"I've found inconsistencies in the original investigation. Witness statements that contradict each other. Evidence that was logged but later disappeared." He tapped the photograph. "And these symbols, which were photographed but never analyzed."

Emily was silent for a moment, processing this information. "So what happens now?"

"Officially, you're free to go. No charges for last night's photography session." Alistair closed the folder. "Unofficially, I think we should continue this conversation. Your historical knowledge could provide context I'm missing."

"And your access to the police archives might help explain why these symbols keep appearing at significant moments in Veritas's history." Emily stood, shouldering her bag. "I'm usually at Café Antiqua in the Old Market Square around four. Their coffee is decent, and the back tables are private enough for conversation."

Alistair nodded, standing as well. "Four o'clock, then."

As she turned to leave, he added, "Miss Robinson? Be careful with your research. Professor Chambers was investigating the Silentium before he died. That might not be a coincidence."

Emily paused at the door. "Detective Inspector, in my experience, there are very few coincidences in Veritas. Just patterns we haven't recognized yet."

After she left, Alistair remained standing, staring at the crime scene photograph. His superiors had expected the Chambers case to keep him occupied but ultimately lead nowhere. Instead, it had led him to Emily Robinson and her mysterious symbols.

He returned the photograph to its folder and reached for his coat. Before meeting Emily later, he needed to visit the university archives. If Professor Chambers had been researching the Silentium before his death, there might be records of his work—records that could explain why someone had carved those symbols into his desk, and perhaps why he had died.

Outside the police station, the October sky hung low and gray over Veritas. The medieval spires of the university buildings pierced the clouds like accusations, their ancient stones keeping secrets that had outlasted generations of inquiries. Alistair turned up his collar against the chill and headed toward the campus, his mind already constructing a new theory of the case—one that now included silver astrolabes and doctoral students with too much curiosity for their own good.

---

Emily left the police station with her thoughts racing. Detective Inspector Finch was not what she had expected. There was a sharpness to him, an attention to detail that reminded her of her own approach to research. And now they shared a mystery—the symbols that connected a medieval astrolabe to a fifty-year-old murder.

She checked her watch. Nearly noon. She had four hours before meeting Finch at Café Antiqua, and she intended to use them productively.

Her first stop was Professor Thorne's office. Their scheduled meeting had been at eight that morning, but her unexpected detainment by campus security had made that impossible. She hoped to catch him between lectures.

The History Department occupied the third floor of Harrington Hall, a Victorian addition to the university's medieval core. Professor Thorne's office was at the end of a long corridor lined with portraits of stern-faced academics from centuries past.

Emily knocked on his door, hearing the familiar shuffling of papers that always preceded his response.

"Come in, come in," called Thorne's distracted voice.

She entered to find him surrounded by stacks of books and manuscripts, his desk barely visible beneath the academic debris. He looked up, his expression shifting from confusion to recognition.

"Emily! I expected you this morning."

"I was unavoidably detained," she said, closing the door behind her. "By the police, as it happens."

That got his full attention. "The police? Whatever for?"

Emily settled into the worn leather chair across from his desk. "Campus security objected to my photographing the cornerstone symbols last night. But that's not the interesting part." She leaned forward. "The detective who interviewed me is investigating a cold case from 1972—the murder of Professor Edward Chambers."

Thorne went very still. "I see."

"You knew him."

It wasn't a question, but Thorne nodded anyway. "Edward was a colleague. Brilliant medieval historian with a particular interest in the university's early records." He removed his glasses, polishing them with his handkerchief—a gesture Emily recognized as a stalling tactic. "His death was a tragedy that affected the entire department."

"Professor, the symbols from the silver astrolabe were carved into Chambers' desk." Emily watched his face carefully. "The same symbols you pointed out to me yesterday."

Thorne replaced his glasses, his movements deliberate. "That is... significant."

"Is that why you warned me to be careful? Did you know about the connection to Chambers' death?"

"Not specifically, no." Thorne sighed, suddenly looking older than his sixty-five years. "But I knew the symbols have been associated with... incidents throughout the university's history. Moments of upheaval or revelation."

"What exactly are they, Professor? What do they mean?"

Thorne rose from his desk and moved to the window, looking out over the quadrangle where students hurried between lectures. "They're called the Veritas Symbol, though that's a relatively modern name. In medieval texts, they're referred to as 'the serpent's path' or 'the seven-pointed star.'"

"A map," Emily said, remembering her conversation with Detective Inspector Finch.

"In a sense." Thorne turned back to face her. "The complete symbol appears nowhere in Veritas except on that silver astrolabe. Everywhere else, we find only fragments—pieces of a whole that has been deliberately scattered throughout the city."

"But why? What's the purpose?"

"That, my dear, is the question that has occupied scholars for centuries." He returned to his desk and opened a drawer, removing a small leather-bound book. "This was Edward's journal. It came into my possession after his death."

Emily stared at it. "You never turned it over to the police?"

"The police at that time were... less than thorough in their investigation. And there were concerns about certain sensitive university matters becoming public." He held out the journal. "I believe you should read it. But not here, and not all at once. Some knowledge is best absorbed gradually."

Emily took the journal, feeling its weight—both physical and metaphorical. "Professor Chambers was killed because of what he discovered, wasn't he?"

"I don't know," Thorne said, and for once, Emily believed he was being entirely truthful. "But I do know that the Veritas Symbol has always attracted both those who wish to protect knowledge and those who wish to exploit it. Edward was caught between those forces, as you may be now."

"And which are you, Professor? A protector or an exploiter?"

Thorne smiled sadly. "I'm a teacher, Emily. My role is to guide students toward understanding while ensuring they have the wisdom to use what they learn responsibly." He gestured toward the journal. "Read it carefully. And perhaps share your insights with your new detective friend. A fresh perspective might reveal what we've been missing all these years."

Emily slipped the journal into her bag. "I'm meeting him at four. At Café Antiqua."

"A public place. Good." Thorne nodded approvingly. "Trust your instincts, Emily, but verify everything. Even what I tell you."

As she left his office, Emily felt the weight of the journal against her side. Professor Thorne had given her a piece of the puzzle—perhaps the most important piece. But she couldn't shake the feeling that he was still holding something back.

She checked her watch again. Three hours until her meeting with Detective Inspector Finch. Just enough time to begin reading Professor Chambers' journal and to visit one more location where the Veritas Symbol had been hidden in plain sight for centuries.

The wind had picked up as she crossed the quadrangle, carrying the scent of rain and fallen leaves. Emily pulled her jacket tighter and quickened her pace. Above her, the spires of the university reached toward the darkening sky, their ancient stones bearing silent witness to generations of secrets—some of which, she was beginning to believe, had been kept for very good reasons.
