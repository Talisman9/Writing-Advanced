# Analysis of AI Writing Hallmarks to Avoid

## Common AI Writing Problems

### 1. Explicit Thematic Statements
- **Problem**: Directly stating thematic relevance instead of implying it
- **Example**: "The prototype wasn't just a technological breakthrough; it was a philosophical one."
- **Fix**: Show the philosophical implications through character reactions, dialogue, or consequences

### 2. Repetitious Writing
- **Problem**: Repeating similar ideas with slightly different wording
- **Example**: "She was exhausted. The fatigue weighed on her like a heavy blanket."
- **Fix**: Choose the strongest phrasing and eliminate redundancies

### 3. Lack of Subtlety
- **Problem**: Over-explaining emotions, motivations, or symbolism
- **Example**: "His anger was evident in his clenched fists, showing how frustrated he was with the situation."
- **Fix**: Trust readers to interpret emotional cues without explanation

### 4. Telling Instead of Showing
- **Problem**: Stating character traits or emotions directly rather than demonstrating them
- **Example**: "She was a brilliant scientist who cared deeply about ethics."
- **Fix**: Show brilliance through problem-solving and ethical concerns through decisions

### 5. Generic Descriptions
- **Problem**: Using common, predictable descriptors lacking specificity
- **Example**: "The beautiful sunset painted the sky with vibrant colors."
- **Fix**: Use unexpected, precise details that reveal character perspective

### 6. Overuse of Adverbs
- **Problem**: Relying on adverbs instead of stronger verbs
- **Example**: "She walked quickly to the lab."
- **Fix**: "She strode to the lab."

### 7. Stilted Dialogue
- **Problem**: Dialogue that sounds unnatural or overly formal
- **Example**: "I am experiencing significant concern regarding the prototype's stability."
- **Fix**: "The prototype's stability worries me."

### 8. Predictable Narrative Patterns
- **Problem**: Following expected story beats without subversion
- **Example**: Perfect three-act structure with predictable turning points
- **Fix**: Introduce unexpected complications or resolutions

### 9. Emotional Distancing
- **Problem**: Describing emotional moments with clinical detachment
- **Example**: "The news of her colleague's death caused her to experience grief."
- **Fix**: Ground emotional experiences in physical sensations and specific thoughts

### 10. Overreliance on Clich√©s
- **Problem**: Using familiar phrases and metaphors
- **Example**: "Time stood still as she waited for the results."
- **Fix**: Create fresh comparisons relevant to the character's background and setting
